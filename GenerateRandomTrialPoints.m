%This script generates a random set of trial points from which we can pick
%one to start the algorithm. It's useful in two ways. One is that we don't
%have to spend the computational effort in generating random trial points
%every time we run the algorithm. The other is that we can for instance
%start with the same trial point every time, and run controlled
%experiments.

%Logic:
%We need to remove a certain number of vehicles from the network. We do this by
%randomly choosing a few OD pairs, and then remove 25 % of the demand from
%each of the OD pair.

%In the end this script just saves the third column of the OD pair table.
%It assumes that the order of OD pairs is maintained in the rest of the
%script.

%Parameters to set: 

%From now on, only the Demand values belonging to the TopODIndices OD pairs
%will be stored in the variables throughout the algorithm. However, the
%text file that is written for Aimsun Model creation willcontinue to have
%all the OD pair values.
