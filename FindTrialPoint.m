%This script finds a new trial point and writes the result into the 
%'WorkingDirectory'. Also updates the Array of points tried out

%In this version, the script optimizes a metamodel and finds the next trial
%point. Also, I use the updated formulation, in which we can remove a fixed
%number of carrs from the network, and we need to pick how many from each
%of the OD pairs.

function [TrialPoint] = FindTrialPoint(iter,baseODMatrix,HOMEDIRECTORY,Betas,Evaluated_Points,NUM_VEHICLES_TO_REMOVE,TopODIndices)

    %We need to select a random trial point;
    TrialPoint = PickRandomTrialPoint();
    
else
    %We have to optimize the current metamodel to get the new trial point.
    %Starting off with a quadratic metamodel, in which the objective
    %function is a quadratic function of the list of non zero OD Matrix
    %demands
    TrialPoint = OptimizeMetamodel(Betas,baseODMatrix,Evaluated_Points(iter-1,:),NUM_VEHICLES_TO_REMOVE,TopODIndices);
